## 🖤 what is dxrkfetch?

`dxrkfetch` is a minimal and moody system info tool for **Linux** and **macOS** — a fork of cute nonsense turned into a sharper, darker utility.
It displays system stats (OS, kernel, uptime, shell, etc.) in a clean, ASCII-powered format — built for **dark terminals**, **noir moods**, and **dead-eyed productivity**.
